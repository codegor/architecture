# 📋 ADR001: Use Vue.js Frontend with PHP Monolithic Backend for Nail Master Management System

## ✅ Status
Accepted

## 📖 Context
The Nail Master Management System requires a scalable, responsive platform that can handle real-time updates, multi-user scenarios, and complex business logic for appointment scheduling and analytics. The system needs to be accessible across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices while maintaining high performance and security.

## 🎯 Decision
We will adopt a modern web-based architecture using:
- **🎨 Frontend**: Vue.js with TypeScript for type-safe, reactive UI development
- **⚙️ Backend**: PHP with monolithic architecture for unified codebase and business logic
- **🗄️ Database**: Cloud-based relational database (PostgreSQL) for reliable data persistence
- **⚡ Real-time**: WebSocket support for live calendar synchronization
- **☁️ Hosting**: Cloud infrastructure with automatic scaling and backups

## 💡 Rationale
1. **⚡ Developer Productivity** - Vue.js provides gentle learning curve with excellent documentation; PHP monolithic reduces complexity
2. **📱 Cross-platform Compatibility** - Web-based solution works on all devices without native apps
3. **🔄 Real-time Capabilities** - WebSocket support enables instant appointment synchronization
4. **🔧 Operational Simplicity** - Monolithic architecture simplifies deployment, debugging, and maintenance
5. **💰 Cost-effective** - Leveraging managed services and single codebase reduces operational overhead
6. **🌐 Community & Ecosystem** - Vue.js and PHP have strong communities with extensive libraries and tooling

## 📊 Consequences

### ✨ Positive
- Rapid deployment and updates without user installation
- Seamless experience across devices
- Simpler deployment pipeline with monolithic architecture
- Single codebase easier to understand and maintain
- Lower operational complexity compared to microservices

### ⚠️ Negative
- Monolithic scaling limitations at extreme scale
- Dependency on internet connectivity
- Browser compatibility considerations for Vue.js
- PHP backend tightly coupled business logic may require refactoring if microservices needed later

## 🔀 Alternatives Considered
1. **React + Node.js** - Rejected: More complex ecosystem, higher learning curve for smaller team
2. **Native Mobile Apps** - Rejected: Higher development cost, separate codebases, slower time-to-market
3. **Microservices Architecture** - Rejected: Added complexity not needed for current project scope

## 🚀 Implementation Notes
- Start with core features (calendar, clients, services) in single PHP backend
- Implement Vue.js components for reactive UI updates
- Plan for WebSocket integration for real-time features
- Document API endpoints for potential future mobile app development
