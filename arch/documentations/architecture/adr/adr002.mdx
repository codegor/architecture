# 📋 ADR002: Select Laravel Framework as Main PHP Framework

## ✅ Status
Accepted

## 📖 Context
The Nail Master Management System requires a robust PHP framework to handle backend development efficiently. The framework must provide excellent tooling for database management, authentication, API development, and maintainability while ensuring the team can develop features rapidly.

## 🎯 Decision
We will adopt **Laravel** as the primary PHP framework for the backend development:
- **🏗️ Framework**: Laravel (latest LTS version)
- **📦 Package Manager**: Composer for dependency management
- **🗄️ ORM**: Eloquent ORM for database interactions
- **🔐 Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum for API authentication
- **⚡ Queue System**: Laravel Queue for background job processing
- **📧 Notifications**: Laravel built-in notification system

## 💡 Rationale
1. **⚡ Developer Productivity** - Laravel's expressive syntax and built-in features accelerate development
2. **🔧 Rich Ecosystem** - Extensive packages and tools available through Composer and Laravel ecosystem
3. **📚 Excellent Documentation** - Comprehensive, well-written documentation reduces learning curve
4. **🛡️ Security Features** - Built-in protection against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF attacks
5. **🔄 Migration System** - Version control for database schema changes
6. **🌐 Community Support** - Large, active community with abundant resources and packages
7. **🧪 Testing Support** - Built-in testing capabilities with PHPUnit integration

## 📊 Consequences

### ✨ Positive
- Rapid API development with built-in routing and controllers
- Standardized project structure improves code maintainability
- Eloquent ORM simplifies database operations and relationships
- Built-in authentication and authorization reduce security implementation time
- Laravel Artisan CLI automates repetitive tasks
- Easy integration with Vue.js frontend (aligned with ADR001)

### ⚠️ Negative
- Framework overhead may impact performance for very high-traffic scenarios
- Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with Laravel conventions
- Framework updates require careful version management
- Some "magic" features may obscure underlying implementation details

## 🔀 Alternatives Considered
1. **Symfony** - Rejected: More complex configuration, steeper learning curve for team
2. **CodeIgniter** - Rejected: Less modern features, smaller ecosystem compared to Laravel
3. **Vanilla PHP** - Rejected: Would require building common features from scratch, slowing development
